As a programmer i am intended to practice the Data structures and algorithms 

Big (O) - When things get more and more complex then which one is faster. Go with Bird and Slow internet example where when the file transfer is done from internet and through a bird bird reach faster in the building compare to the internet. with increase in the file that are need to be tranfer can increase the time complexity where Bird to reach from one place to another will be constant and more occurate one and does not impact the file size
